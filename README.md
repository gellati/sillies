# Sillies

Simple gif animation builder.

Has a simple front end in which the user can select a number of animated gifs, which are then combined in the backend to one gif, and then the result is displayed on the front end.

Front end components in frontend folder, backend components in backend folder.

Built with Javascript and Python.

Still much TODO
